# d3-react-squared

ALPHA VERSION. 
There will be major changes coming up (ToDo list will follow).
Feedback, ideas, PRs, etc. very welcome!

## Goal of this repo
The aim is to provide a react component that loads either pre-made charts or custom made (d3) charting solutions, based on a simplified API.

The component provides viewboxed charts that are modularized. Details to follow.

## Requirements
We designed this component to be **very lightweight**. All you need to do is include it in your existing [React.JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) app.

Only additional requirement:
* [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io)

Note: we run it in a webpack setup.

## Documentation / API
Will follow soon
